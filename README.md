# Mario-Responsive
This webpage is was created to test a few concepts including on load CSS animation, JavaScript prompt and responsive design. It is all hand coded with no libraries or frameworks being used. You will be prompted to enter your name when you first go to the website and please keep in mind that the site does not do anything and has no purpose besides HTML5 experimentation and testing.
